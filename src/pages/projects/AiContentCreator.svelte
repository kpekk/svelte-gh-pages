    title="AI content creator"
    description="
    More and more content on social media is AI-generated.<br><br>
    
    The main idea for this project was to try to generate a few dozen non-refined videos, 
    to see how easy it exactly is.<br><br>

    I also wanted to learn more about AI and it's current capabilities in the hands of someone like me.<br><br><br>
    
    Bottom line - generating content using AI is too easy to be taken lightly."
