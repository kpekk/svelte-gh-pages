    <i>Choose the muscle groups you want to focus on in your next workout
    and, in the touch of a button, see the workout plan from your email!</i><br><br>

    I created this project during my bachelor degree studies, when I had more free time
    and a gym within walking distance. <br><br>
    
    The goal was to automate workout plan creation, as at that point, it was the most tedious part 
    of working out for me. Eliminating that would mean that I would be much more likely to go to the
    gym - and yup, it worked.<br><br>

    Setting up the app is quite unconvenient - that's why I'm slowly but surely working on the second version of this project 
    (using a mobile-first approach).
